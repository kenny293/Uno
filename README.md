Implementation of Uno in Java
1-player game where the user plays against the computer. 
7 cards are dealt out to each player at the beginning of the game. A player may always draw a card from the deck.
If the entire deck is used during play, the top discard is set aside and the rest of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck.
In a two-player game, the Reverse card acts like the Skip card.
